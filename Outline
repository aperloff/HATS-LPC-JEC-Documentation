Introduction
	Why do we need JEC
	What are JEC?
		What are the levels/factorizations?
		JER and uncertainties?
	How do guarantee we are correcting what we thing we are correcting?
	What jet collections?
	What corrections are available?
	PUPPI?

Technical
	What form do the corrections come in (text, SQLite, Database)?
		Explain the text files
		Explain what and SQLite files is
		Explain how the database works and who (AlCa) is in charge
Backend	Software
	How do corrections in the DB get to the analyzer?

User Software (How to apply corrections)
	53X - Legacy
		GEN-SIM-RECO/AODSIM
			PFBRECO (us!) - take reco::candidates and recluster them using the JetProducers and then the JetCorrector class (add a jet collection to the sequence by hand)
		PAT
			pat::candidates to make a pat::jet, which is then corrected using JetCorrector class (addJetCollection/switchJetCollection)
	72X - Uh Oh!
		GEN-SIM-RECO/AODSIM
			PFBRECO works
		PAT
			pat works
	73X
		GEN-SIM-RECO/AODSIM
			PFBRECO still works
			JetToolbox - feed in either reco::PFCandidates which will be corrected and returned as pat::jets
		PAT
			PAT still works
			JetToolbox - Can't use it unless you saved the reco::PFCandidates; otherwise feed in pat::PFCandidates and get pat::jets
		MINIAOD
			Jets are already corrected
			JetToolbox - feed in pat::packedPFCandidates and get pat::jets
			PatTools - addJetCollection/switchJetCollection
	74X
		GEN-SIM-RECO/AODSIM
			PFBRECO
			JetToolbox - as in 73X
		PAT
			PAT still works
			JetToolbox - as in 73X
			Jet Uncorrector/Recorrector - https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/8288
		MINIAOD
			Jets are already corrected
			Or you can uncorrect and recorrect them - Jet Uncorrector/Recorrector - https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/8288
			JetToolbox - works

	If you're totally confused there are correction on-the-fly
		In FWLite/C++
		In the full framework
